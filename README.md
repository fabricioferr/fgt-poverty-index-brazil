This repository show up a chunk of my thesis results, were I estimate a Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) Poverty Index from Brazilian States in 2019 and I decomposed it to States from Brazil using two poverty lines: 499,00 BRL and 1,364.46 BRL. Basically the poverty lines were chosen based in previous literature and a minimum well-being level necessary to Brazilian households (chosen by me).

I hope that simple analysis let us to think about the deprivation in our country and how to change it.
